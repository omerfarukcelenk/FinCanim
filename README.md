A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Firebase Auth Setup

This project includes a lightweight `FirebaseAuthService` at `lib/services/firebase_auth_service.dart`.

To use Firebase Auth you must perform platform-specific setup:

- Android: add `google-services.json` to `android/app/` and apply the Google Services Gradle plugin.
- iOS/macOS: add `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `ios/Runner` (and to `macos/Runner` if building for macOS).

Optionally, use the FlutterFire CLI to generate `firebase_options.dart` and initialize with explicit options. Example:

```dart
// in main.dart before using any Firebase services
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'firebase_options.dart'; // generated by FlutterFire CLI

await Firebase.initializeApp(
	options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);
```

If you prefer not to use generated options, the service calls `Firebase.initializeApp()` which will use platform config files when present.

After adding the native configuration files, run:

```powershell
flutter pub get; flutter clean; flutter run
```
